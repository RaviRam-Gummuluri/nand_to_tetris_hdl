## From NAND to Tetris Projects

This repository contains my solutions for the "From NAND to Tetris" course projects. The course focuses on building a computer system from the ground up, starting with elementary logic gates and culminating in a basic operating system.

### Getting Started

To run and test the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/from-nand-to-tetris.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and Install the required software and dependencies:

    HDL simulator: nand2tetris Hardware Simulator
    HDL files: nand2tetris HDL files

3. Run the Hardware Simulator

4. Load and run the HDL files for each project in the Hardware Simulator.

### Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

Projects 01/ - Contains the HDL files and documentation for Project 01: Boolean Logic.

Projects 02/ - Contains the HDL files and documentation for Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic.

Feel free to explore each project directory to understand the implementation and refer to the project documentation for more details.

### Contributing
If you find any issues or have improvements to suggest in the solutions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are welcome!

### Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the creators and authors of "From NAND to Tetris" for their invaluable contributions to computer science education. Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken's project-based course and accompanying book, "The Elements of Computing Systems," have provided an exceptional learning experience, taking learners from the basics of logic gates to the creation of a fully functional computer system. Their dedication, vision, and clear explanations have made complex concepts accessible and engaging.
